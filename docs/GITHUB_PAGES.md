# GitHub Pages Deployment

## Important Note

This repository contains a full-stack application with both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express). 

**GitHub Pages only hosts static websites (frontend only)**, so the demo at `https://abdulbaesit.github.io/colorgrid` will be a **frontend-only version** for showcase purposes.

## What works on GitHub Pages:
- ✅ Welcome page and UI design
- ✅ Registration/Login forms (UI only)
- ✅ Game interface design
- ✅ Responsive design and dark mode
- ✅ All visual components

## What doesn't work on GitHub Pages:
- ❌ User authentication (requires backend)
- ❌ Real-time multiplayer (requires Socket.io server)
- ❌ Database operations (requires MongoDB)
- ❌ Game logic and state management

## For Full Functionality:

To experience the complete game with multiplayer features, deploy the full-stack application to:

### Recommended Platforms:
- **Backend**: Heroku, Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, or deploy with backend
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (free tier available)

### Quick Setup:
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up MongoDB Atlas
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy backend to Heroku/Render
5. Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Demo Purpose

The GitHub Pages demo is intended to showcase:
- Modern React UI/UX design
- Responsive layout and components  
- Dark mode implementation
- Game interface design
- Professional code structure

For the complete multiplayer gaming experience, please follow the deployment guide.
